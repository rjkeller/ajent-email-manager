<h1>What You Can Do With Ajent</h1>

<div class="line">
	<div class="unit size1of3">
		<h2>Manage Your Subscriptions:</h2>

			<li><strong>HIDE</strong> emails you might want to get at some point but rarely need to see. <strong class="ajent">Ajent</strong> allows you to turn email subscriptions &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; at your convenience. No need to unsubscribe and re-subscribe, again, it is just a click of a button!</li>
